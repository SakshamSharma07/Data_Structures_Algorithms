- **Queues**: Array-based, linked list-based, circular, and priority queues.
- **Trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, red-black trees, and segment trees.
- **Graphs**: Adjacency matrix and list representations, BFS, DFS.
- **Heaps**: Min-heap and max-heap implementations.
- **Hash Tables**: Open addressing and chaining methods.

### Algorithms

This section contains implementations of various algorithms. Each algorithm has its own folder with detailed explanations and code examples.
