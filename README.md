1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Data_Structures_Algorithms.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
    ```sh
    cd Data_Structures_Algorithms
    ```
3. Open the desired folder to view the implementation of data structures or algorithms.

## Overview

### Data Structures

This section contains implementations of various data structures. Each data structure has its own folder with detailed explanations and code examples.

- **Arrays**: Implementation of simple and dynamic arrays.
- **Linked Lists**: Singly, doubly, and circular linked lists.
- **Stacks**: Array-based and linked list-based stacks.
- **Queues**: Array-based, linked list-based, circular, and priority queues.
- **Trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, red-black trees, and segment trees.
- **Graphs**: Adjacency matrix and list representations, BFS, DFS.
- **Heaps**: Min-heap and max-heap implementations.
- **Hash Tables**: Open addressing and chaining methods.

### Algorithms

This section contains implementations of various algorithms. Each algorithm has its own folder with detailed explanations and code examples.

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, heap sort.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Linear search, binary search.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, Kruskal's, Prim's algorithms.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Fibonacci sequence, knapsack problem, longest common subsequence, matrix chain multiplication.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Activity selection, Huffman coding, Kruskal's, Prim's algorithms.
- **Backtracking**: N-queens problem, Sudoku solver, subset sum problem.
- **Divide and Conquer**: Merge sort, quick sort, binary search.
